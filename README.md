# Mock-Microphone-Design

This project was created for my Engineering Foudnations lab class. Tasked with creating something in a CAD software, I decided to create a microphone. The silver/gray represent the outter shell of the microphone, the copper represents where all the electrical components would go, and the black represents the microphone shield. A few details were left out unintentionally but overall meet the expectations.
