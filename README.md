# Mock-Microphone-Design

This mock design is of a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Microphone created in Inventor. I wanted to test my skills and see how accurate measurements played a role in designing in CAD software.

Parts 1 and 2 are just the shell/casing of the microhpone. The black part of Part 3 is the microphone with the shield attached, and the copper part is where the internal electronic components were stored. Assembly1 is all the parts combined together.
